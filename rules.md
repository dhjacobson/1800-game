# 1800 - Rules & Strategy Guide

## Overview
1800 is a historical strategy game set in 19th Century Europe. The game can be played by 2-8 players, each leading of one of eight European powers: Great Britain, France, Prussia, Austria, Russia, Spain, Italian States, or Ottomans. For 120 years (starting in 1800, divided into three eras with eight rounds each), players compete for economic and military dominance. In 1920, the player who's built the most prosperous empire -- and done the best job fulfilling their empire's secret "national ambition", will be crowned the victor.

## Game Contents
1. Board: a map of Europe
2. Play Mats: one for each player, showing with default policies and technologies, with a place to track your prosperity
3. Player Tokens: colored discs (pops); colored cones (regiments); colored rings (trade tokens)
4. Resource Tokens: blue cubes (production); brown cubes (food); green cubes (commerce)
5. Miscellaneous Tokens: black rectangles (factories); pink cube (for prosperity-tracker); black coin (dealer token)
6. Cards: admin cards; military cards; national ambition cards; global event cards; development cards (which includes policies, institutions, and technologies)

## Game Setup

### Starting positions
The game has a number of standard starting positions, though after you've played a few times we highly recommend trying out some of your own custom starting positions. For a standard start, each player will have six pops, four on countryside provinces, and two in cities on factories. The standard start positions for the eight default nations are:
- Great Britain: one factory on London and Liverpool; one pop on London, Liverpool, Wales, Midlands, Scotland, and Ireland
- France: one factory on Paris and Lyon; one pop on Paris, Lyon, Normandie, Acquitaine, Occitanie, and Champagne
- Prussia: one factory on Berlin and Konigsberg; one pop on Berlin, Konigsberg, Pommerania, Hesse, Saxony, and Rheinland
- Austria: one factory on Vienna and Budapest; one pop on Vienna, Budapest, Bohemia, Galicia, Tyrol, and Transylvania
- Russia: one factory on Moscow and St. Petersburg; one pop on Moscow, St. Petersburg, Livonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Crimea
- Spain: one factory on Madrid and Sevilla; one pop on Madrid, Sevilla, Leon, Aragon, Andalucia, and Morocco
- Italian States: one factory on Rome and Milan; one pop in Rome, Milan, Tuscany, Costa Adriatica, Napoli, and Piedmont
- Ottomans: one factory in Constantinople and Bucharest; one pop in Constantinople, Bucharest, Bursa, Ankara, Bulgaria, and Greece

When playing with fewer than eight people, we suggest adjacent starting positions to increase interaction. For beginners, we suggest playing as France, Prussia, Austria, or Great Britain.

### Decks
After setting up the board, you'll need to set up three decks: the admin deck, the military deck, and the development deck. The admin and military decks are simple: just shuffle the decks and place them face down on the table. For the development deck, shuffle together all of the policies and institutions; then add the technology cards for Era I (marked with an "I" at the bottom-right of the technology-type symbol), and shuffle the deck. Lay the technology cards for Era II and Era III out in separate piles. They will be added to the development deck at the beginning of Eras II and III, respectively.

### National Ambition
Lastly, before starting the game, each player draws a random National Ambition card. Look at your National Ambition, but do not share it with others. At the end of the game, you will receive victory points that, along with your total prosperity, will determine who wins the game.

### Dealer Chip
At the beginning of the game, choose a player to be the first dealer, and give the dealer chip to that player. The dealer will deal cards for the development draft, and the player to the left of the dealer will pick first in the development draft and play their turn first. At the end of each round, pass the dealer chip to the left.

## Gameplay

### Pops, Regiments, & Provinces
Your nation is nothing without it's people, represented by small colored discs and referred to as "pops". Each pop resides in a single province, and can only move to a different province if enabled by a card ability. A countryside can have no more than two pops in it, while a city can have any number of pops. Pops in countryside provinces are referred to as "farmers", while pops in city provinces are referred to as either "laborers" (if they're on a factory) or "bourgeois" (if they're not on a factory).

With one exception, control of a province is determined by the number of pops that each nation has in the province. If a nation has more pops in a province than any other nation, that player controls the province. In this case, pops in the province that do not belong to the controlling nation are called "minority pops".

The exception is if there is a regiment in the province. Regiments are represented by colored cone pieces. A single province may only have one regiment in it, and any province with a regiment is controlled by the nation the regiment belongs to. In this case, pops in the province that do not belong to the controlling nation are called "occupied pops". Occupied pops and minority pops still produce resources for you, but you do not gain the benefits of controlling the proavince, and beware -- they may be vulnerable to conversion or extermination.

### Improvements
Provinces can be augmented with several different types of improvements. Once an improvement is placed on a province, it remains there for the rest of the game, unless it is explicitly destroyed by a player action. Cities can support 5 improvements, while countrysides can support two. If a province is at it's maximum number of supported improvements, a player who wishes to build a new improvement on that province may destroy an existing improvement. 

There are four types of improvements:
- **Factories** provide +1 production per turn when worked by a pop. Factories may only be placed in cities.
- **Farms** provide +1 food per turn when worked by a pop. Agricultural technology may allow one pop to work more than one farm. Farms may only be placed in countrysides.
- **Markets** provide +1 commerce for every two pops working on a market in a city. The number of pops that can work on a single market is limited by your infrastructure technology. In addition to producing commerce directly, markets contribute to the size of your "market networks". Markets may be placed in either cities or countrysides, but in countrysides they do not produce any commerce; the only purpose of markets in countrysides is to expand your network. 

### Cards
There are five kinds of cards in 1800, each with it's own unique card-back: Admin Cards, Military Cards, Development Cards, Global Events, and National Ambitions.

#### National Ambition & Global Event Cards
National Ambition and Global Event cards are both important to gameplay, but their usage is very straightforward. National Ambitions are drawn randomly at the beginning of the game, giving each player a unique and secret way to earn victory points. Global Events are drawn at the beginning of every round, granting an effect that impacts all players for the duration of the round.

#### Admin & Military Cards
Admin and Military Cards are playable action cards that grant immediate effects when played. They're earned primarily by activating specific Development Cards, though you also get Military Cards for losing battles. Both Admin and Military Cards are secret, and can be held for as long as you want before you choose to play them. Military Cards can be played during wars to give bonuses to your armies, while Admin Cards can be played at any time during your turn. In addition, some Admin Cards specify other times when they can be played.

#### Development Cards
Development Cards are at the core of 1800: they define the shape and style of your empire, and over the course of the game it's Development Cards that will allow you to transform from a pre-industrial nation with minimal production capabilities to a flourishing empire with bustling commerce and mature political institutions.

Development Cards, unlike Admin & Military Cards, are not held in a "hand". When you pick a Development Card, you play it immediately, placing it face-up on the table in front of you. Once in play, some Development Cards grant effects, specified on the cards.

In many cases, resources can the placed on Development Cards, as indicated by squares featuring wheat (food), a hammer (production), or coins (commerce). On some cards, this will grant a static effect. For instance, for each production placed on an Industrial Agriculture card, you gain an additional one food per turn. In most cases, however, placing resources on a Development Card allow you to "activate" it. When sufficient resources have been placed on the card, you may activate the card, which may involve an additional cost, like discarding an Admin Card. When you activate the card, remove all resources that you've placed on the card, and then gain the reward described on the card. For instance, if you've placed three production and an Industrial Policy card, you can activate it during your turn by discarding an Admin Card. When you do, remove the three production from the card, and build a factory.

Development Cards come in three varieties. All have the same card-back and are placed in the Development Deck together, but each has unique characteristics:
- **Policies** are cards that define the core political, economic, and industrial structure of your nation. You'll have three Policies active at all times: one political, one economic, and one industrial. When you play a new Policy, place it on top of your existing policy of the given type, replacing that policy. You start the game with three basic policies: Autocracy, Early Industrialization, and Landed Gentry
- **Technologies** are cards that define the level of technologic advancement your nation has achieved. You'll have five Technologies active at all times: one Food Technology, one Agricultural Technology, one Military Technology, one Infrastructure Technology, and one Communication Technology. Just like with Policies, when you play a new Technology, it will replace an existing one. However, unlike Policies, each Technology you adopt will be definitionally better than the one that proceeded it. There are requirements for adopting a new technology, but in other ways they are significantly easier to acquire compared to other Development Cards: when they are not chosen in a Development Draft, they stay on the board, and Research Institutions and Research Grants allow you to search the deck for Technologies that have already been discovered.
- **Institutions** are cards that define the various governmental and non-governmental features of your nation. While there are strict limits on how many Policies and Technologies you can have, there is no limit on your Institutions; you can even have multiple copies of the same card.

### Game Progression

#### Eras
The game is split into three eras: Era I, Era II, and Era III. Each era consists of eight rounds. At the beginning of each era:
1. Shuffle all Global Event cards and place them face-down on the table.
2. Shuffle the technology cards for the new era into the development deck.

#### Rounds
Each era consists of eight rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:
1. Draw a Global Event card. For the duration of the round, all players are subject to the effects of the Global Event card.
2. Conduct a Development Draft. The dealer draws cards from the top of the Development Deck, drawing one for each player, and places them face-up on the table. Starting to the left of the dealer, each player may pick a face-up Development card and play it. Note that players may only choose technologies for which they meet the requirements. After each player has either picked a card or passed their opportunity to pick, any remaining Policies and Institutions are placed in the discard pile. Remaining technologies are left face-up and can be chosen in future Development Drafts.
3. Each player plays their turn, starting with the player to the left of the dealer. See the next section for details about how each player's turn progresses.
4. After each player has played their turn, any players that either declared war or were the target of a war declaration fight a war. If a Great War Global Event Card was drawn, all players fight a war.

#### Player Turns
During each round, each player gets to play their turn (step 3 above). Each player's turn proceeds as follows:
1. Collect resources:
  - To determine the amount of food to collect, calculate your food output and food consumption. Your base food output is equal to the number of farmers you have (Industrial Agriculture cards may further increase your food output), your food consumption is equal to the number of laborers, bourgeois, and regiments you have. If your food output is greater than your food consumption, you have a food surplus: collect food tokens equal to the difference. If your food output is less than your food consumption, you have a food deficit: either sacrifice a pop or remove food tokens from cards you own equal to the difference. Note that a food deficit may also cause you to lose prosperity, depending on your Food Technology.
  - Collect one production token for each of your laborers.
  - Collect commerce tokens as instructed by your Development Cards and trade routes. The most common sources of commerce are Economic Policies, Infrastructure, Stock Exchanges, European trade routes, and overseas trade route monopolies. For European trade routes, collect one commerce per turn for each trade route. For overseas trade routes, collect one commerce per turn for each trade route that is not shared with any other players. This is called a trade route monopoly.
2. Place resources on Development Cards. You may only place resources on Development Cards with slots for that specific resource type (indicated by colored squares featuring wheat, a hammer, or coins), and you cannot place more of a resource on a card than there are slots for that resource.
3. Activate Development Cards. Development cards with arrows on them can be activated. Some cards have a cost to activation, like discarding an Admin Card. When you activate a card, you get the indicated reward immediately. Note that each Development card can be activated only once each turn.
4. End of turn: move pops and regiments. If your Transportation Technology or Economic Policy permits you to move regiments or pops at the end of your turn, you may do so at this time.

#### Wars
While there are many more subtle approaches to gain advantageous over other nations, war is a decisive way to acquire new territory or punish enemies for their transgressions. There are three ways a way can be initiated: by a player with the Conquest ambition, by a Great War global event, or by a player using a Diplomatic Action card in repsonse to an aggressive action by another player.

During a war, players involved in a war take turns making actions, starting with the player to the left of the dealer. Each player may make a number of actions determined by their communication technology. An action in war can be any one of the following:
* **Move a regiment to an adjacent province.** You may not move a regiment onto a province with a regiment belonging to you or to a nation that is not involved in the war. You may, however, move your regiment onto a province in which there is one regiment belonging to another player involved in the war. If you do this, a battle is initiated. You may not move a regiment involved in a battle. At the end of the war, the battle will be resolved.
* **Draft a conscripted regiment.** Place a regiment piece on top of one of your pops. That regiment cannot move, but otherwise functions as a normal regiment. While the regiment is conscripted, the pop consumes one food and does not produce resources.
* **Play a Military Card.** If the card you play asks you to specify a province, use a player token to mark the province you specified.
* **Pass your action.** Do nothing. You may still use future actions.

When a player runs out of actions, if other players still have actions, that player must pass their turn while other players continue to play in the same order. After every player involved in the war has used all of their actions, resolve any battles that have been initiated as follows
1. Each player calculates their battle score as follows:
  * Count the number of supporting regiments, where a supporting regiment is defined as a regiment that is adjacent to the battle but is *not* adjacent to any other battles involving your regiments.
  * Add any bonuses from you Military Technology
  * Add any bonuses from Military Cards
2. The player with the highest score wins the battle. If both players have the same score, the player with the most pops in the province (not including regiments) wins. If both players have the same score and the same number of pops in the province, the player who took their action first in the war wins.
3. The losing regiment is removed from the board. If it was a conscripted regiment, remove the conscripted pop as well. Then, the losing player draws a military card.
